            <h2>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking</h2>
            <date>10/19/2021</date>
            <p>
                New York Times<a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/"> "10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking"</a> teaches a lot about visual communication through images. The article mentioned that we should employ certain practices when using images on the web. We have to pay great attention to the picture and capture small details that would lead to a bigger picture. We should always see the images as how it is, help the readers focus on the main picture. Good pictures should always have something that can leave the readers with thoughts and questions. For example, what is the story that they are telling?

                <br>
               Pictures can leave the readers with a big question in their head. The readers should always use clues within the photograph to figure out the story. With this, it can be an effective storytelling device. Perhaps it can be used to send a message to the audience. Or even, it could strike new conversations about fascinating details that the readers might notice. Regardless, there is an immense amount of creativity that the designer can use to employ an effective storytelling using photographs.

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</h2>
            <date>10/19/2021</date>
            <p>
                I read <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows.</a> To start, a modal window is "an element that sits on top of an application's main window". Simply, this modal window has many different uses. It is a tool to acquire user input, or show any additional information that is useful to navigate through the page. It may also give the users options to view show other pages. Regardless, there are many different uses behind the structure of the page.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Best practices for form design should always have options for the users to escape the web. This includes using buttons to escape or backtrack progress that the user has made on the web. The web should always have directions for the user to input information. Sizing and location should always guide the user experience by fitting the most important information in a convenient way. Initiate the users by promoting them to let the users take action over their screens. Be aware of accessibility for the users to take actions on the page.

                There are a lot of different ways to improve the legibility and user experience of websites. These methods focus on the designer’s decision to improve the layout of content and images. One thing that struck out me is to always “ask the easy questions first”. Instead of asking a dense question first, we can ask the easier questions to prevent intimidation of the readers. There should always be requirements for the users in case the system cannot pick up any inputs and cannot give the users feedback on their next steps.  Be very transparent with the users about how their information will be used. The website should always employ user experience principles, which include accessibility features to deliver effective communication.
