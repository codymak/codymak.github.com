        <h2>Best Practices for form design</h2>

        <p>
            There are a lot of different ways to improve the legibility and user experience of websites. These methods focus on the designer’s decision to improve the layout of content and images. One thing that struck out me is to always “ask the easy questions first”. Instead of asking a dense question first, we can ask the easier questions to prevent intimidation of the readers. There should always be requirements for the users in case the system cannot pick up any inputs and cannot give the users feedback on their next steps.  Be very transparent with the users about how their information will be used. The website should always employ user experience principles, which include accessibility features to deliver effective communication.
