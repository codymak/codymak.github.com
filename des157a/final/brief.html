            <p>When I visited <a href="https://cuberto.com/">Cuberto's Website </a>Cuberto's website, the interface appeared very simple and minimalistic. However, as I scrolled through the website, all the interaction features were hidden in plain site. Upon hovering over texts and images, the interactions became visible and changed the entire experience for the user. It was very fascinating to see how a minimalistic layout could hold a lot of potential for great story telling. The colors begin to change and the images are warped in a way where it is able to tell a story. Through one hover effect begins many directions for the users to take. It is exactly what I plan to use for my final project in the Every Pictures revisions. </p>

            <p><a href="https://muffingroup.com/blog/best-interactive-websites/">30 Species Website</a> uses purely CSS to create interactive animations. This website was fascinating because all the interactions were very simple. Simply scroll down to reveal more stories about the different endangered species. It was very beautiful to witness all the animations being done as I scroll through the pages. I also enjoyed how the background color changes as each animals were changing. The design layout is very enjoyable to see, and it's minimalistic layout through CSS makes it feel even more exciting.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>
            The two comparisons were inspiring for me because they employed very simplistic designs. Yet, they were able to create an effective website to display their stories effectively. I want to set the goal of creating an interactive design while making it simple and effective
